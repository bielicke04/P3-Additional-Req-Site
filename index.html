      <p>Edward St. John Gorey (February 22, 1925 â€“ April 15, 2000) was an American writer and artist noted for his illustrated books. His characteristic pen-and-ink drawings often depict vaguely unsettling narrative scenes in Victorian and Edwardian settings. His books may be found in the humor and cartoon sections of major bookstores, but books such as "The Object Lesson" have earned serious critical respect as works of surrealist art.</p>
